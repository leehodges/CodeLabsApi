## Access Rails Environment Variables

    EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit

If this is a new project use the above command. Copy the above Environment Variables and set appropriately. Make sure the master key generated in master.key is copied over to the 
project on Heroku, if not Heroku can not decrypt the environment variables. If this is not a new project, before running
the above command make sure you have the master key copied from Heroku, and/or speak with your Team Lead to set the project
up correctly.

<div id="general">

## API Documentation

We are using swagger for API Documentation. By default only the localhost server is setup. Going into swagger_helper to setup the production & staging urls

API documentation is available at `/api-docs` and is protected by basic auth. The username and password are set in the environment variables.


## Test Suite

You can run the test suite by calling `rspec`. This project uses RSpec for controller tests through swagger.

## Background Processing

This project comes with Sidekiq and Sidekiq scheduler built-in as gems. Sidekiq leverages Redis, and Redis is provided as a gem. When running the application, you'll need to run Sidekiq alongside the normal Rails server in order for the background processing to work locally.

You may want to look into utilizing something like Foreman to turn on and off all of your services at once. Otherwise, you can start Sidekiq in a new terminal by running `bundle exec sidekiq`.

## Enhancements
      
      
In the root directory there is now a credentials.rb file. Using:

`ruby credentials.rb`

The file will run allowing you to select an editor to edit rails credentials with.
<ol>
<li>You need to have master key already set in the project correctly</li>
<li>The script will need to be updated to match your credential layout</li>
<li>Make sure to have options for both VSCode & RubyMine</li>
<li>This only works on Macs</li>
</ol>
